Hello,

My name is evnmrk. I am a soon-to-graduate computer science and cybersecurity student. You can expect to find many different types of content here, such as code snippets, CTF writeups, and film reviews. See my [Hello World](https://evnmrk.xyz/post/hello-world/) post for more information.

This website was generated via [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the theme is a modified [Even theme](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even).
