## Hello,

My name is Evan. I am a computer science/cybersecurity graduate. You can expect to find many different types of content here, such as code snippets, CTF writeups, and more. I hope to use this blog as a complement to my resume and CV. See my [Hello World]({{< ref "posts/hello-world.md" >}}) post and [1st anniversary]({{< ref "posts/one-year.md" >}}) post for more information.
