      <description>Introduction I am currently finishing my last semester of university. My final computer science elective I am taking is Linux Administration. It is a fairly easy and straightforward class, but the reason I am taking this class is to learn more about the Linux Operating System, specifically when it comes to system administration.
One of the topics I wanted to learn about is bash scripting. I have seen many bash scripts online, but I have never taken the time to learn how to read or write them.</description>
